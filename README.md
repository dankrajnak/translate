# Translate

I made this to learn ngrx.  The app will take any input text, and many google-translated supported languages.  The app then pipes this input text through google translate.  It's cool to see how your input is changed as it passes through the different languages.  In order to make this work, you'll need to get an API key from the google cloud platform for google translate.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
